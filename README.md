# Maaz Sajid | Digital Craftsman Portfolio

A responsive, high-performance personal portfolio website built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3**. 

Designed with a "Digital Craftsman" aesthetic—featuring dark charcoal tones, grainy textures, and serif typography—this project demonstrates mastery of core web technologies without reliance on external frameworks or libraries.

## 🎯 Assignment Compliance
This project was built to satisfy strict academic constraints:
- ✅ **No Frameworks:** No React, Angular, or Vue.
- ✅ **No Libraries:** No Bootstrap, Tailwind, or jQuery.
- ✅ **No External Assets:** No FontAwesome (SVG icons used inline).
- ✅ **Pure CSS:** Layouts built with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- ✅ **Vanilla JS:** Native DOM manipulation and `fetch` API for data.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The design is inspired by the "Iron Hill" aesthetic, focusing on:
- **Atmosphere:** Deep warm charcoal backgrounds with rust/amber accents.
- **Typography:** A blend of *Playfair Display* (Editorial) and *Courier Prime* (Technical).
- **Texture:** subtle film grain overlays and "glassmorphism" navigation.
- **Motion:** Custom CSS keyframe animations for a "journal reveal" effect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Structure:** HTML5 (Semantic)
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Variables, Grid, Flexbox, Keyframes)
* **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+, Async/Await, Intersection Observer API)

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Project Loading:** Although the CV data is currently hardcoded for accuracy, the architecture supports fetching GitHub repositories via the GitHub REST API.
* **Smooth Scroll & Navigation:** Native smooth scrolling with offset handling for the fixed glass navbar.
* **Intersection Observer:** Elements fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, triggered by efficient native browser observers.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that adapts from 4k desktops to mobile screens.

# Maaz Sajid | Digital Craftsman Portfolio

A responsive, high-performance personal portfolio website engineered with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.

Designed with a "Digital Craftsman" aesthetic—featuring dark charcoal tones, grainy textures, and serif typography—this project bridges the gap between technical precision and visual storytelling, focusing on raw performance, semantic architecture, and a fluid user experience.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
The design is inspired by the "Iron Hill" aesthetic, focusing on:
- **Atmosphere:** Deep warm charcoal backgrounds with rust/amber accents.
- **Typography:** A blend of *Playfair Display* (Editorial) and *Courier Prime* (Technical).
- **Texture:** Subtle film grain overlays and "glassmorphism" navigation.
- **Motion:** Custom CSS keyframe animations for a "journal reveal" effect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Structure:** HTML5 (Semantic)
* **Styling:** CSS3 (Variables, Grid, Flexbox, Keyframes)
* **Logic:** JavaScript (ES6+, Async/Await, Intersection Observer API)

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Project Loading:** Architecture supports fetching repository data dynamically via the GitHub REST API to keep the portfolio up-to-date.
* **Smooth Scroll & Navigation:** Native smooth scrolling with intelligent offset handling for the fixed glass navbar.
* **Intersection Observer:** Elements fade in and slide up as the user scrolls, triggered by efficient native browser observers for high performance.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully fluid layout that adapts seamlessly from 4k desktops to mobile screens.
